## Introduction

This was our last project in the OOP module, meaning we have mastered the OOP and SOLID principles. 

In the first sprint we were given skeleton code for a webshop API and our task was to enhance it with product filtering, expandit with a cart and payment feature and fill it with products.

The second sprint was focused on testing, logging and migrating to a database, along with some minor features.
